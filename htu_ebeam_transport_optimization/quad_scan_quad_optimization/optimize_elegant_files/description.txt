backtracking example

by Miguel Gracia (miguel.gracia@tausytems.com)

THIS IS JUST AN TEST example!!!, so GUI and rsopt integration design can start. 

This example:

From Twiss parameters found on screen A3 in the HTU beam line (calculated from the EMQ-3 scan (#22) on 8/8/23) this example:

1. Back propagates and calculate the twiss parameters at SRCTOPMQ1 position.
2. The twiss parameters found at SRCTOPMQ1 are propagate forward and the strength values of EMQ1H, EMQ2V, EMQ3H and the distance SRCTOPMQ1 are optimized to match the twiss parameters at the entrance of the undulatory. 


The command elegant HTU_back2matching.ele generates several output sdds files but the final values of EMQ1, EMQ2 and EMQ3 are stored in the HTU_base_lattice_matched.lte. The optimization out of the box values are : 


SRCTOPMQ1: EDRIFT,L=0.05311304357681505
EMQ1H: KQUAD,L=0.1408,K1=-1.330551668500184,N_SLICES=10
EMQ2V: KQUAD,L=0.28141,K1=-0.07192547430026644,N_SLICES=20
EMQ3H: KQUAD,L=0.1409,K1=-2.401687132513245,N_SLICES=10

Note: Extra description can be found in the .ele and .lte files. There's a possible conversion issue that its being fixed in the mean time the initial strength values of EMQ1H,EMQ2V and EMQ3H are just the one found in HTU_base_lattice_matched.lte file found in the folder base_lte_ele_files of this repo.



Future improvements and current work:

There are several improvements being made right now. 

1. For now the optimized values EMQX and SRCTOPMQ1 are stored in the HTU_base_lattice_matched.lte, In the lab the EMQX adjustments are made by tuning current in AMPS, elegant uses strength  [1/m^2] so 
the retrieved values need to be converted if they want to be useful for operators, I'm creating a script that will create a file with the final values in lab units [Amps]. Need some discussion on what is the best approach for a GUI integration. 

2. Automatic reading of the scan information based on export.py (Guillaume's script), (currently experiencing OS-related errors).

3. rsopt integration of this example

! Further discussion:

1. Need to discuss what is the best optimization function and modify accordingly, For now, this examples uses the one defined in the input file HTU_match_fodo.ele file found in the folder base_lte_ele_files of this repo.  

2. Need to decide where to end the back propagation and set the wher the optimization matching should be (entrance of undulator or A3).   

3. Review the lattice configuration, check if the lattice is actually matching with the actual HTU on site beam line.
